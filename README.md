The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network of devices that have sensors or actuators that are linked together via wired or wireless networks. 
IoT has grown fast over the last decade; it has become an integral part of daily life and many companies rely on IoT technology to enhance their own.
IoT networks tend to have a large number of devices, due to which the volume of data that goes between them is huge.
The influence these devices have on our daily lives is incredible, due to which security is a must.
One of the best ways in which security of an IoT network can be increased is by utilizing machine learning techniques to create intrusion detection systems.
There are a vast range of efficient and trustworthy machine learning algorithms that can be used to enhance security in these networks and systems.
